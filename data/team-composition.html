<ul class="indent-1 roman-list">
	<li>Each team must submit a roster of up to 12 competitors to the competition director of the first CCDC event they participate in during a given CCDC competition season.  Rosters must be submitted at least two weeks prior to the start of that event.  All competitors on the roster must meet all stated eligibility requirements.  No changes to the team roster will be permitted after the team competes in their first CCDC event.  The competition team must be chosen from the submitted roster.   A competition team is defined as the group of individuals competing in a CCDC event.</li>

	<li>Once a CCDC event has begun, a team must complete the competition with the team that started the competition.  Substitutions, additions, or removals of team members are prohibited except for extreme circumstances.</li>

	<li>Teams or team members arriving after an event’s official start time, for reasons beyond their control, may be allowed to join the competition provided a substitution has not already been made.  Event coordinators will review the reason for tardiness and make the final determination.</li>
	<li>Each team will designate a Team Captain for the duration of the competition to act as the team liaison between the competition staff and the teams before and during the competition.  In the event of the Team Captain’s absence, teams must have an identified team liaison serving as the captain in the competition space at all times during competition hours.</li>
	<li>An institution is only allowed to compete one team in any CCDC event or season.</li>
