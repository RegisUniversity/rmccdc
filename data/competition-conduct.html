	<li>Teams must not connect any devices or peripherals to the competition network unless specifically authorized to do so by Operations or White Team members.</li>				
	<li>Teams may not modify the hardware configurations of competition systems.

All private communications (calls, emails, chat, texting, directed emails, forum postings, conversations, requests for assistance, etc) with non-team members including team representatives that would help the team gain an unfair advantage are not allowed and are grounds for disqualification and/or a penalty assigned to the appropriate team.</li>

	<li>Team representatives, sponsors, and observers are not competitors and are prohibited from directly assisting any competitor through direct advice, “suggestions”, or hands-on assistance.

Team members are free to talk to Red Team members during official competition events such as breakfasts, dinners, mixers, and receptions that occur outside of live competition hours.</li>				
	<li>Teams are free to examine their own systems but no offensive activity against other teams, the Operations Team, the White Team, or the Red Team will be tolerated.  This includes port scans, unauthorized connection attempts, vulnerability scans, etc.  Any team performing offensive activity against other teams, the Operations Team, the White Team, the Red Team, or any global asset will be immediately disqualified from the competition.  If there are any questions or concerns during the competition about whether or not specific actions can be considered offensive in nature contact the Operations Team before performing those actions.</li>				
	<li>Teams are allowed to use active response mechanisms such as TCP resets when responding to suspicious/malicious activity.  Any active mechanisms that interfere with the functionality of the scoring engine or manual scoring checks are exclusively the responsibility of the teams.  Any firewall rule, IDS, IPS, or defensive action that interferes with the functionality of the scoring engine or manual scoring checks are exclusively the responsibility of the teams.</li>				
	<li>All team members will wear badges identifying team affiliation at all times during competition hours.</li>
