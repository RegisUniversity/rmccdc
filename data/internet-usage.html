<h5>Internet Usage</h5>
<ul class="indent-1 roman-list">
	<li>Internet resources such as FAQs, how-to's, existing forums and responses, and company websites, are completely valid for competition use provided there is no fee required to access those resources and access to those resources has not been granted based on a previous membership, purchase, or fee. Only resources that could reasonably be available to all teams are permitted. For example, accessing Cisco resources through a CCO account would not be permitted but searching a public Cisco support forum would be permitted.  Public sites such as Security Focus or Packetstorm are acceptable. Only public resources that every team could access if they chose to are permitted.</li>
	<li>Teams may not use any external, private electronic staging area or FTP site for patches, software, etc. during the competition.  Teams are not allowed to access private Internet-accessible libraries, FTP sites, web sites, network storage, email accounts, or shared drives during the competition.  All Internet resources used during the competition must be freely available to all other teams.  The use of external collaboration and storage environments such as Google Docs/Drive is prohibited unless the environment was provided by and is administered by competition officials.  Accessing private staging areas or email accounts is grounds for disqualification and/or a penalty assigned to the appropriate team.</li>
	<li>No peer to peer or distributed file sharing clients or servers are permitted on competition networks unless specifically authorized by the competition officials.</li>
	<li>Internet activity, where allowed, will be monitored and any team member caught viewing inappropriate or unauthorized content will be subject to disqualification and/or a penalty assigned to the appropriate team. This includes direct contact with outside sources through AIM/chat/email or any other public or non-public services including sites such as Facebook.  For the purposes of this competition inappropriate content includes pornography or explicit materials, pirated media files, sites containing key generators and pirated software, etc. If there are any questions or concerns during the competition about whether or not specific materials are unauthorized contact the White Team immediately.</li>
	<li>All network activity that takes place on the competition network may be logged and subject to release.  Competition officials are not responsible for the security of any information, including login credentials, which competitors place on the competition network.</li>
