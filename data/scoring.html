<h5>Scoring </h5>
<ul class="indent-1 roman-list">
	<li>Scoring will be based on keeping required services up, controlling/preventing un-authorized access, and completing business tasks that will be provided throughout the competition.  Teams accumulate points by successfully completing injects and maintaining services.  Teams lose points by violating service level agreements, usage of recovery services, and successful penetrations by the Red Team.</li>
	<li>Scores will be maintained by the competition officials and may be shared at the end of the competition.  There will be no running totals provided during the competition.  Team rankings may be provided at the beginning of each competition day.</li>
	<li>Any team action that interrupts the scoring system is exclusively the responsibility of that team and will result in a lower score.  Any team member that modifies a competition system or system component in order to mislead the scoring engine into assessing a system or service as operational, when in fact it is not, may be disqualified and/or the team assessed penalties. Should any question arise about scoring, the scoring engine, or how scoring functions, the Team Captain should immediately contact the competition officials to address the issue.</li>
	<li>Teams are strongly encouraged to provide incident reports for each Red Team incident they detect.  Incident reports can be completed as needed throughout the competition and presented to the White Team for collection.  Incident reports must contain a description of what occurred (including source and destination IP addresses, timelines of activity, passwords cracked, access obtained, damage done, etc), a discussion of what was affected, and a remediation plan.  A thorough incident report that correctly identifies and addresses a successful Red Team attack may reduce the Red Team penalty for that event â€“ no partial points will be given for incomplete or vague incident reports.</li>
